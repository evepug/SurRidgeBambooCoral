### Haltuch_et_al_2013_referencechronology.csv
California margin petrale sole otolith Delta14C results, which we used as a reference chronology to create age models for the Sur Ridge bamboo coral records. These data were generated as part of a project of the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division, Northwest Fisheries Science Center and published by Haltuch et al, 2013. The data was obtained through personal communication with Dr. Haltuch. <br>Reference:<br>Haltuch M. A., Hamel O. S., Piner K. R., McDonald P., Kastelle C. R. and Field J. C.
