Data Analysis of Deep-Sea Bamboo Coral Bulk &amp; Compound-Specific Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope Data from Sur Ridge, CA

This repository contains all datasets and code required to perform the main data analyses and generate the figures for the manuscript "Deep-sea coral amino acid isotope records reveal decadal-scale climate-driven planktic ecosystem fluctuations" by authors Genevieve M. Pugsley, Thomas P. Guilderson, Danielle S. Glynn, Yuan Shen and Matthew D. McCarthy, as submitted to Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta. 

For detailed metadata of the new bamboo-coral carbon and nitrogen stable isotope datasets generated for this work, please refer to our entry in the NCEI paleoclimatology database: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/38859. 

For more information and corresponding references for supporting datasets used in this work, please refer to the README files in the 'datasets' and 'R_MixSIAR_mixingmodel' folders. 

To perform the main calculations and generate all figures from the manuscript, create a new folder in the desired location on your PC, and download the 'Jupyter_Notebooks' folder and the 'datasets' folder. Make sure each of these are saved as subfolders in the same directory. 

Running 'Figs2through8andsupplemental.ipynb' from the Jupyter_Notebooks folder will create a new subfolder called 'figures' in your directory (if it doesn't exist already) and generate Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 from the main text and Figures S1, S2, S3 and S4 from the supplementary information as individual .pdf files. 

Running 'Fig1and9_chla.ipynb' from the Jupyter_Notebooks folder will create a new subfolder called 'figures' in your directory (if it doesn't exist already) and generate Figures 1 and 9 from the main text as individual .pdf files. 

All R code and datasets required to reproduce the MixSIAR endmember mixing analysis are located in the 'R_MixSIAR_mixingmodel' folder-please see the README file in that directory for further details.
